# color-website
I made a basic website by using javascript and html. It is similar to website "what the hex?" but I didn't use any databases. I made a much simpler version as an exercise.

This is the opening page of the website. When you click on colors, the box on the top takes their color and also shows their hex code.

This is one example. When you click the others, it does the same.
